Study Timer Application Built with Electron.js

I created this study timer application using Electron.js because I was tired of timer apps on my phone that drain the battery. 
I wanted to build a small and calm study companion that sits quietly with me while I study.

While the little companion studies in the corner, the timer keeps running in the background. You can pause and restart the timer whenever you want.

I tried to keep the interface as simple as possible. There is nothing distracting in the app. 
It only shows a monthly data page that tracks how long I study, and a small study companion that works with me.
