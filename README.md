# Study Timer Application (Electron.js)

I created this study timer application using **Electron.js** because I was tired of timer apps on my phone that drain the battery.
I wanted to build a small, calm study companion that sits quietly with me while I study.

While the little companion studies in the corner, the timer keeps running in the background. You can **pause and restart the timer** whenever you want.

I tried to keep the interface as **simple as possible**. There is nothing distracting in the app.
It only shows a **monthly data page** that tracks how long I study, and a small study companion that works with me.
